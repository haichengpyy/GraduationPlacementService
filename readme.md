Developed a website based on Flask framework to provide graduation guidance services for students.

Realised distinct functionalities for different roles, including students, alumni, and administrators. Students can easily access a variety of information, alumni have the opportunity to contribute valuable information, and administrators hold crucial approval rights, as well as generate yearly report.

You can download all the files and create a python project, if you are interested.

Make sure that mySQL AND APACHE is activated since this program uses local databases. (Recommend using XAMPP control panel)

If you successfully run the program, please enter http://127.0.0.1:5000/uicer/login in your browser to enjoy the service!
